  * 	SINGLE: fires only one of the bays.
  * 			- For the first time the primary store is fired.
  * 			- To give some cooling time to the torpedo stores, torpedo stores are fired alternating.
  * 			- But if the store next in line is empty, the ship tries to fire the other store.
  * 			- If the fired store reports a failure, the ship does not try to fire the other one.
  * 	ALL:	tries to fire both of the torpedo stores.

  * @return whether at least one torpedo was fired successfully
